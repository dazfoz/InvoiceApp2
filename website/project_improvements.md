# Freelance Invoice App - Bolt: Improvement Opportunities

## Missing Features
1. **User Registration**: The login screen has a "Sign up" button but it's not implemented (marked with TODO)
2. **Settings Screen Navigation**: Navigation to settings is marked with TODO in the main.dart file
3. **My Invoices Navigation**: Navigation to the user's invoices list is marked with TODO
4. **PDF Generation**: While the app has dependencies for PDF generation (pdf and printing packages), the actual invoice PDF generation functionality appears to be missing
5. **Email Invoices**: No functionality to email invoices to clients
6. **Payment Integration**: No payment gateway integration for clients to pay invoices online
7. **Dashboard Analytics**: The dashboard is very basic without analytics or financial insights
8. **Recurring Invoices**: No support for creating recurring invoices for regular clients
9. **Invoice Templates**: No customizable invoice templates
10. **Expense Tracking**: No expense tracking functionality for comprehensive financial management

## UI/UX Improvements
1. **Responsive Design**: Ensure the app works well on different screen sizes

3. **State Management**: Consider more consistent state management approach
4. **Offline Support**: Add offline capabilities with data synchronization
5. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize Firebase queries and data loading
